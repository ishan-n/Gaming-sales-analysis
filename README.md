**The objective of this project is to identify areas where Electronic Arts can improve its market share in the video game industry.**

Electronic Arts (EA) has been one of the top video game companies since 1982. Gaming industry has become competitive with an increase in new publishers and genres. Our challenge with this project is to analyze what genres EA can tap into to increase overall profitability in North America. We will use descriptive analytics to determine which genres EA should focus its time on, while also considering its competitors.
